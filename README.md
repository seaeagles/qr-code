## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- HSL Color Model
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I found this exercise beneficial to practice flexbox and other CSS fundamentals. As I have been working with Vite, which automatically centers content by default, it was a good opportunity to revisit positioning elements with flexbox.

Not only that, I also discovered the font family "Outfit", which will be perfect for future projects!
